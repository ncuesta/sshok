# sshok is a simple tool for managing a user's SSH configuration, allowing for a simpler and saner
# way of storing large SSH configuration sets.
#
# Just put any groups of settings inside $SSH_CONFIG_DIR (defaults to $HOME/.ssh/config) and use
# this script instead of `ssh` to perform any SSH task.
#
# This script will take any files inside $SSH_CONFIG_DIR and concatenate them into $SSH_CONFIG_FILE
# so that the SSH configuration can be split into different files for easier management. This
# script can be thought of as an SSH wrapper, which first determines whether the configuration file
# needs to be updated, updates it (according to what has been determined) and then runs the
# original ssh command with any argument provided to this script.
#
# Every time this script determines it needs to update the $SSH_CONFIG_FILE, it will backup the
# current configuration first and then overwrite the file. Backups have two levels: a first one,
# thought for quick restores which only keeps the last configuration in a file stored alongside
# the $SSH_CONFIG_FILE and suffixed with ".bak", and a second one which is thought for keeping a
# larger log of the different versions of the configuration file, which will back up every version
# of the $SSH_CONFIG_FILE to $BACKUPS_DIR, suffixing each version with the timestamp of the moment
# when the backup was made. This means that if anything should go wrong, a previous version of the
# configuration could be restored.
#
# This file is intended to work as a self-documented script, so please do read the comments in it
# as they aim at guiding anyone looking at it.

# The following variables indicate where are located the source files and the target configuration
# file, and can be overridden by setting their values in environment variables before running
# this script. This is a pretty simple way of allowing the customization of the scripts' default
# behavior.
#
# For instance, the script could be run like follows to store the resulting configuration file in
# an alternative location if your SSH installation differs from the standard one, or if you would
# like to test the outcome of running this script, or even if you would like to generate an SSH
# config file to share with your SO:
#
#   $ SSH_CONFIG_FILE=/tmp/my_ssh_config sshok
